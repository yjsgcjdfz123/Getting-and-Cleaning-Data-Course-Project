This assignment uses data from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository, we use the "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set" as our data source.

The data taken from the website includes lots of measurements, what we use in this project is only part of it, including "subject_train/test", "X_train/test", "y_train/test" and description files in the "UCI HAR Dataset" main folder.

Subject_train/test: identify the subject who perform those measurement, each row identifies a certain subject, between 1-30
X_train/test: measurement data, each row is performed by a certain subject, has 561 column in total, indicating 561 measurements
y_train/test: identify what the activity is when the measurement is performed, each row indicates a certain activity.
              1 means WALKING, 2 means WALKING_UPSTAIRS, 3 means WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, 4 means SITTING, 5 means STANDING, 6 means LAYING
              
In this work, I merge the test and train data from the original file and create a new file with descriptive labels of the rows, columns and variables.
The mean and standard deviation measurement data from all the measurements are then taken out and form a new dataset and exported as a new file.
Finally average of the measurements in the new dataset is calculated and exported as a new file as well.
